# geocaching_website
These files represent a website that I created in 2003 to create a puzzle and the solution for a couple geocaching puzzles. I've had to move the website from host to host
over the years and each time I've had to scour through old hard drives and directories to find the necessary files. I finally decided to host the files here in the
hopes that I will be able to find them when I need them again. There have been a few changes to PHP in the intervening years as well and everytime I have to move
these files I invariably have to relearn enough PHP to get them working again. If you stumble across these files and know what geocaching is and are intested in
finding the caches that these files provide the puzzle/solution to, please be my guest to comb through the code to find the final coordinates without bothering to
find the solution in the pedestrian manner. A puzzle is a puzzle and any way you get to the solution is valid by me.

If you've never heard of [Geocaching](http://geocaching.com) then please checkout their website. Geocaching is what happens when nerds go outside.
